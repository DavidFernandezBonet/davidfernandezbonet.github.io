You hear someone playing the drums, but turns out it‚Äôs your heart. Congratulations! You just won the lottery, hit the jackpot!\nFinally, the Universe gave what you deserve. After all that suffering, you are rich! And not rich as in, look at my brand new car, but rich as in look at my brand new island. You cannot help but feel rewarded, blessed, and above all: like the luckiest being on the entire planet. However, feelings are feelings and reality is reality. You had luck, indeed, but snap back to reality: it was the bad kind of luck.\nAndrew Jackson Whittaker Jr. was an American businessman, with a career and a construction company. As a semi-accidental result of his entrepreneurship and ambition, his company was doing more than just ok, and he was beyond financially stable, and was approaching boredom, without breaking and backing away.\nExperts estimated Jack‚Äôs net worth to be about 17 million US dollars before he hit the jackpot. The Powerball multi-state lottery was, at the time, the largest prize sum ever won by a single individual and a single ticket, in the history of the American lottery. Awarding him with an amount of a grand total of 315 million dollars. Mr. Whittaker was determined, or, at least he said so at the time, to continue with his life, as if nothing had changed. He hoped he would be able to spend more time with his family, while continuing to answer his own phone, open his own front door, and perhaps, if need be: turn to God for guidance. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still working on me.‚Äù: was his interpretation of God‚Äôs words.\nWhat happens when one wins such a gravitational sum? Well, Whittaker decided to donate part of his winnings to the Church and other Christian Charities, deeming 10% to be quite a generous quantity. Needless to say, the Church of God was delighted and in humble gratitude built a multi-million dollar facility for the innocent christian children. Nevertheless, Christian Altruism didn‚Äôt turn out to be his savior.\nWise old Whittacker frequented a local restaurant, where he was used to breaking his daily fast: breakfast, getting his daily dose of caffeine. Attracted by the aroma of caffeine in the cute cafe, other addicts arrived. The lucky winner quickly became the subject of financial stalkers, that is, mobs of people whose daughters had coincidentally acquired cancer and were in desperate need of Whittackers charitable christian values. Currency burning with clarity.\nSome of them even had prepared powerful presentations, generating genius business ideas. Presenting perpetual motion machines, a feat which would insult the intellectual integrity of physics fanboys and fanatics. Others, lacking the lucrative spirit for financial finessing, bluntly begged for bars of cold cash.\nAs a result, Whittaker walked away from the cafe, leaving his favorite breakfast place in the past. His future found security in hired professionals: operators were ordered to sort out his mail, a couple of detectives filtered out con men and scammers. Admittedly, he really wanted to make good choices, helping people who needed him.\nSadly, this is not the story of such a saint. Two weeks after the lucky day, he was seen in the Pink Pony. Far from being a harmless happy hippie place, it was a harmful horrible horrendous nightmare.. The Pink Pony strip club caters to slithering snakes like white man Whittaker. Throwing thousands of dollars on the counter, claiming that he was there to ‚Äúwhoop it up‚Äù, Whittaker began dishing out demands.\nThe manager of the club suggested that he re-pocket his wads of cash, stating that the strip club serves up serious struggle for those asking for trouble. Equity in that environment is equivalent to toying with trouble.\nAlthough he escaped assault that night, he most definitely drank himself to hell and returned, heading home in a lottery winner‚Äôs taxi, that is, a luxurious limousine. Thereafter, things really started to go severely south.\nLosing money may be sad, but being betrayed by so-called friends is heart-breaking.

Nevertheless, Christian Altruism didn‚Äôt turn out to be his savior.\nWise old Whittacker frequented a local restaurant, where he was used to breaking his daily fast: breakfast, getting his daily dose of caffeine. Attracted by the aroma of caffeine in the cute cafe, other addicts arrived. The lucky winner quickly became the subject of financial stalkers, that is, mobs of people whose daughters had coincidentally acquired cancer and were in desperate need of Whittackers charitable christian values. Currency burning with clarity.\nSome of them even had prepared powerful presentations, generating genius business ideas. Presenting perpetual motion machines, a feat which would insult the intellectual integrity of physics fanboys and fanatics. Others, lacking the lucrative spirit for financial finessing, bluntly begged for bars of cold cash.\nAs a result, Whittaker walked away from the cafe, leaving his favorite breakfast place in the past. His future found security in hired professionals: operators were ordered to sort out his mail, a couple of detectives filtered out con men and scammers. Admittedly, he really wanted to make good choices, helping people who needed him.\nSadly, this is not the story of such a saint. Two weeks after the lucky day, he was seen in the Pink Pony. Far from being a harmless happy hippie place, it was a harmful horrible horrendous nightmare.. The Pink Pony strip club caters to slithering snakes like white man Whittaker. Throwing thousands of dollars on the counter, claiming that he was there to ‚Äúwhoop it up‚Äù, Whittaker began dishing out demands.\nThe manager of the club suggested that he re-pocket his wads of cash, stating that the strip club serves up serious struggle for those asking for trouble. Equity in that environment is equivalent to toying with trouble.\nAlthough he escaped assault that night, he most definitely drank himself to hell and returned, heading home in a lottery winner‚Äôs taxi, that is, a luxurious limousine. Thereafter, things really started to go severely south.\nLosing money may be sad, but being betrayed by so-called friends is heart-breaking. But there is something worse than betrayal, something that cannot be repaired.\nWhittaker‚Äôs car was twice broken into, the culprits were not unknown criminals, but trusted acquaintances. These life-long ‚Äúfriends‚Äù had observed Whittaker‚Äôs routines and machine learned that large quantities of cash were kept in the car. The first time, prescription drugs were put in his drink. The second, they intimidated Whittaker‚Äôs granddaughter, insinuating insults to her person for information. Their methods resulted in a total of $700,000 stolen dollars.\nBrandi, Whittaker‚Äôs granddaughter, was not only pressured to produce information. Worse than that, her loving grandfather gave her large amounts of money. This attracted certain people, and the filtering mechanisms of young teenager Brandi were not well established. Her fickle firewalls fell down, and she did not fare well, and had to ‚Ä¶","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642636800,"objectID":"c301a4a723a3a7610abcdbd68a64c605","permalink":"davidfernandezbonet.github.io/post/so-you-hit-the-jackpot/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"davidfernandezbonet.github.io/post/so-you-hit-the-jackpot/","section":"post","summary":"SO YOU HIT THE JACKPOT?\nYour mouth is wide open, your hands are shaking, your brain is in utter disbelief.

But it is especially outrageous when we are told that our health is a pay-to-win game. It is easy to exploit fears and insecurities, and the wellness industry thrives on those. According to research by the Global Wellness Institute, the wellness industry is valued at $4.5 trillion and is continuing to grow at a historic rate [1]. From an investor point of view, wellness pays off. The industry‚Äôs expansion is clear: wellness tourism, wellness apps, wellness at the workplace‚Ä¶ these concepts are growing and becoming popular [2] [3]. But is it necessary to go to India to find peace, is health something to be downloaded, is yoga the solution to stressful working environments?\nThe dark side of the wellness industry is born when insecurity exploits are combined with unreasonable expectations of ‚Äúbecoming your better self‚Äù. Wellness has become synonymous with productivity and self-optimization. The idea that you can buy an improved version of yourself is, simply put, attractive. The fast, easy path. But wellness isn‚Äôt something that can be consumed. My concern with this path is not only that it can be a scam, but that it poses a threat to the consumer‚Äôs mental health [4]. What happens when you fail to fulfil expectations? When you realize you are not a fit cycler despite all the protein shakes, when you realize you are still bald despite the caffeine shampoo, when you realize that despite the expensive meditation retreat‚Ä¶ you still have cancer? It surely must not be what you bought, people on the ad told nothing but success stories! It has to be faced, you are the problem. And that ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is now crying and trying to figure out what went wrong. Ironically, the wellness industry is disrupting wellness.\nA substantial amount of the wellness industry products are simply not proven to work. Scientifically, that is. For example, homeopathy, vitamins and hair-loss treatments often fall into this category [5] [6] [7]. Having vitamins for breakfast will not make you feel better, but will make your pee tremendously valuable! The problem: it can be as difficult to prove that the product works as it can be to prove that it does not work. Unsurprisingly, it took a while to prove that smoking caused lung cancer. This is because correlation does not imply causation and because companies have moneyed interests. Science, rigorous science, is painfully slow. Marketing, however, is stupidly fast. ‚ÄúI am doing the new carnivore diet. Still stuck with Keto diet? That‚Äôs so 2017!‚Äù.\nHealth might be difficult to come by in certain situations. Being aware of your insecurities and fears is key to avoid falling victim to the wellness industry. Chances are that spending money on a miraculous pill or a trendy diet book will not solve any serious problem. Good sleep, a diverse diet and an active social and physical life are your best bets at staying healthy. It is okay to be afraid of ageing or cancer. It is also okay to accept them when they come.

Until that guy comes. By the way he looks, smells, and walks, there is no doubt; he is as stoned as he will ever be. Two things are inevitable: his stupid question and your sighing. ‚ÄúMan, man. Why are there males and females? You know, why two sexes and not one‚Ä¶ or three?‚Äù\nOf course, you are smart enough to quickly change the topic and proceed to have a great time. However, when finally home and trying to sleep‚Ä¶ it is not possible to get the thing out of your head. We simply accepted that some animals are called male, and others female, without asking what those words really meant. But what is the essence of maleness? What, at bottom, defines a female?\nWe as mammals have no doubt: possession of a penis, bearing of the young, certain chromosomal features and so on are characteristics that define our sex. These criteria are well and all until you realise that it does not work in general. You will never hear: ‚ÄúOh, look at these oak‚Äôs enormous breasts, it must be a female!‚Äù. As a matter of fact, there is only one fundamental feature of the sexes that can be used to label males as males, and females as females, throughout animals and plants. The so-called ‚Äògametes‚Äô.\nGametes are sex cells. Male gametes are much smaller and numerous than females‚Äô. This is true no matter the context, and it defines sex at a fundamental level. The difference is especially pronounced in reptiles and in birds, where a single egg cell is big enough and nutritious enough to feed a developing baby for several weeks. Even in humans, where the egg is microscopic, it is still many times larger than the sperm. Still, I suspect that our stoned friend would not be satisfied with a simple definition. How did this come to be, why are there even males and females?\n¬©Ô∏è Roisin Callaghan To answer that question, we have to assume a world without sex distinction, a world of isogametes (all gametes would be identical). If this scenario is unstable, meaning that it naturally evolves to a scenario with sex distinction, then we will have found a reason for males and females to exist. When two isogametes fuse, both contribute equal numbers of genes to the new individual, and they also contribute equal amounts of food reserves. Conversely, even though sperms and eggs contribute equal numbers of genes, eggs contribute far more in the way of food reserves, and this difference is key.\nThe isogametes world is unavoidably unstable. Errors when replicating gametes do exist, and consequently there will be gametes slightly different than others. In some respects a big isogamete will have an advantage over an average-sized one, because its embryo would get a larger food supply. Therefore, there might be a trend towards bigger gametes. But there is a catch! This trend is open to exploitation. Individuals who produce smaller than average gametes can cash in when fusing with these big gametes. Without investing too much in gametes production, they get the extra-food benefits. Natural selection will favour the production of sex cells that are small and that actively seek out big ones to fuse with.\nSo we can think of two divergent sexual ‚Äòstrategies‚Äô evolving. There is a large-investment or ‚Äòdirect‚Äô strategy. This automatically opens the way for a small investment exploitative strategy. Once the divergence between the two strategies starts, it continues in a runaway fashion. Medium-sized intermediates would have been penalized, because they did not enjoy the advantages of either of the two more extreme strategies and would eventually have disappeared. And just like this, the concept of male and female comes to make sense.\nIn conclusion, because the world is not perfect, there are replication errors. Because the world is not fair, a direct strategy (females) will always go with an exploitative strategy (males). So next time your stoned friend comes to you in search of deep and meaningful answers, you can 1) explain the origins of sex distinction or 2) change the topic and proceed to have fun.\n","date":1621468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621468800,"objectID":"7ede77079d09713d2b2516651968e845","permalink":"davidfernandezbonet.github.io/post/males-and-females.-why/","publishdate":"2021-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"davidfernandezbonet.github.io/post/males-and-females.-why/","section":"post","summary":"It is Friday night: a nice bar, no work to do and not a single worry in your head.

As a matter of fact, there is only one fundamental feature of the sexes that can be used to label males as males, and females as females, throughout animals and plants. The so-called ‚Äògametes‚Äô.\nGametes are sex cells. Male gametes are much smaller and numerous than females‚Äô. This is true no matter the context, and it defines sex at a fundamental level. The difference is especially pronounced in reptiles and in birds, where a single egg cell is big enough and nutritious enough to feed a developing baby for several weeks. Even in humans, where the egg is microscopic, it is still many times larger than the sperm. Still, I suspect that our stoned friend would not be satisfied with a simple definition.

If this scenario is unstable, meaning that it naturally evolves to a scenario with sex distinction, then we will have found a reason for males and females to exist. When two isogametes fuse, both contribute equal numbers of genes to the new individual, and they also contribute equal amounts of food reserves. Conversely, even though sperms and eggs contribute equal numbers of genes, eggs contribute far more in the way of food reserves, and this difference is key.\nThe isogametes world is unavoidably unstable. Errors when replicating gametes do exist, and consequently there will be gametes slightly different than others. In some respects a big isogamete will have an advantage over an average-sized one, because its embryo would get a larger food supply. Therefore, there might be a trend towards bigger gametes. But there is a catch! This trend is open to exploitation. Individuals who produce smaller than average gametes can cash in when fusing with these big gametes. Without investing too much in gametes production, they get the extra-food benefits. Natural selection will favour the production of sex cells that are small and that actively seek out big ones to fuse with.\nSo we can think of two divergent sexual ‚Äòstrategies‚Äô evolving. There is a large-investment or ‚Äòdirect‚Äô strategy. This automatically opens the way for a small investment exploitative strategy. Once the divergence between the two strategies starts, it continues in a runaway fashion. Medium-sized intermediates would have been penalized, because they did not enjoy the advantages of either of the two more extreme strategies and would eventually have disappeared. And just like this, the concept of male and female comes to make sense.\nIn conclusion, because the world is not perfect, there are replication errors. Because the world is not fair, a direct strategy (females) will always go with an exploitative strategy (males).

However, there is a disappointing absence of alien life. Completely upset, you decide to set a new goal in search of suspicious activity. After trying out the Bermuda Triangle and Atlantis with no success, it is the Fountain of Youth‚Äôs turn. But wait, where is it supposed to be? Wouldn‚Äôt it be sensible to seek places where people live long? Immersed in this very same quest was the American National Geographic Fellow Dan Buettner. He did his research, grabbed an Earth globe and circled the places that were known for its unusual longevity, using a blue crayon. In a sudden burst of inspiration, he brilliantly named those regions ‚ÄúBlue Zones‚Äù.\nGranted, there is a tiny possibility that Blue Zones do not contain the Fountain of Youth. For the love of God, maybe miraculous waters are not real. What is, indeed, real is that people residing in such zones live much longer than the average human being. We shall begin a more down-to-earth quest trying to find out why!\nIcaria (Greece): Icaria is an island in Greece where people eat a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil, red wine and homegrown vegetables.\nOgliastra, Sardinia (Italy): The Ogliastra region of Sardinia is home to some of the oldest men in the world. They live in mountainous regions where they typically work on farms and drink red wine.\nOkinawa (Japan): Okinawa is home to the world‚Äôs oldest women, who eat soy-based foods and practice tai chi, a meditative form of exercise.\nNicoya Peninsula (Costa Rica): The Nicoyan diet is based around beans and corn tortillas. The people of this area regularly perform physical jobs into old age and have a sense of life purpose known as ‚Äúplan de vida.‚Äù\nThe Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California (USA): The Seventh-day Adventists are religious people who believe in the second coming (advent) of Jesus Christ. They‚Äôre strict vegetarians and live in tight-knit communities.\nBecause these are small regions with no connection between each other, one could easily argue that the reason for their extended longevity is purely genetic. The whims of heredity and natural selection would be to blame and we would go to sleep grimly thinking of that uncle who passed away early, fearing that it may happen to us. Luckily enough, this is not the case. Detailed studies show that genetics probably account from 20% to about 30% of longevity, marking environmental influences as the main contributing factor. If sounding smart is a priority to you, please do call it epigenetics.\nTo no-one‚Äôs surprise, diet and lifestyle play a huge role in determining a human lifespan. So even though your grandmother is a hundred years old, your diet consisting of kex choklad and 3 daily kanelbullar may not be a good idea. Even during exam weeks. With genetics out of the way, it is possible to determine clear patterns associated with long lives analyzing Blue Zones.\nRegarding their diet, they consume an unusual amount of whole plant foods. Although most groups are not strictly vegetarians, they eat meat or fish around five times a month. This fact concurs with a study done on over half a million people, which states that avoiding meat can significantly reduce the risk of death from heart disease, cancer and other common illnesses. At the same time, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts are packed with fiber, vitamins, minerals and omega-3 fats. They also restrict their calories. Okinawans, for instance, follow the ‚ÄúHara Hachi Bu‚Äù, which is also called ‚ÄúThe 80% Rule‚Äù. As its name indicates, it means stopping to eat when you feel 80% full instead of the usual 100%.\nWhat about alcohol? There is a surprising amount of papers trying to prove that alcohol is good for your body. It is not. A serious study on red wine concluded that one or two glasses per day may be beneficial because‚Ä¶ you guessed it! Not the alcohol. It is actually the grapes‚Äô antioxidants. Nonetheless, people from the Mediterranean Blue Zones drink red wine (in moderation) and their longevity is no joke. This could be linked to their lifestyle. Enjoying a glass of wine with your loved ones could contribute to general happiness and increase life-expectancy.\nExercise is built in their daily lives. Sardinian men go through long stairs and climb up steep hills as their gym replacement. Not because they choose to, but because they must. There is no skipping leg day when raising farm animals. It is not unusual to get proper sleep when the body is exhausted, which is fantastic because it prevents heart diseases and strokes.

For the love of God, maybe miraculous waters are not real. What is, indeed, real is that people residing in such zones live much longer than the average human being. We shall begin a more down-to-earth quest trying to find out why!\nIcaria (Greece): Icaria is an island in Greece where people eat a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil, red wine and homegrown vegetables.\nOgliastra, Sardinia (Italy): The Ogliastra region of Sardinia is home to some of the oldest men in the world. They live in mountainous regions where they typically work on farms and drink red wine.\nOkinawa (Japan): Okinawa is home to the world‚Äôs oldest women, who eat soy-based foods and practice tai chi, a meditative form of exercise.\nNicoya Peninsula (Costa Rica): The Nicoyan diet is based around beans and corn tortillas. The people of this area regularly perform physical jobs into old age and have a sense of life purpose known as ‚Äúplan de vida.‚Äù\nThe Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California (USA): The Seventh-day Adventists are religious people who believe in the second coming (advent) of Jesus Christ. They‚Äôre strict vegetarians and live in tight-knit communities.\nBecause these are small regions with no connection between each other, one could easily argue that the reason for their extended longevity is purely genetic. The whims of heredity and natural selection would be to blame and we would go to sleep grimly thinking of that uncle who passed away early, fearing that it may happen to us. Luckily enough, this is not the case. Detailed studies show that genetics probably account from 20% to about 30% of longevity, marking environmental influences as the main contributing factor. If sounding smart is a priority to you, please do call it epigenetics.\nTo no-one‚Äôs surprise, diet and lifestyle play a huge role in determining a human lifespan. So even though your grandmother is a hundred years old, your diet consisting of kex choklad and 3 daily kanelbullar may not be a good idea. Even during exam weeks. With genetics out of the way, it is possible to determine clear patterns associated with long lives analyzing Blue Zones.\nRegarding their diet, they consume an unusual amount of whole plant foods. Although most groups are not strictly vegetarians, they eat meat or fish around five times a month. This fact concurs with a study done on over half a million people, which states that avoiding meat can significantly reduce the risk of death from heart disease, cancer and other common illnesses. At the same time, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts are packed with fiber, vitamins, minerals and omega-3 fats. They also restrict their calories. Okinawans, for instance, follow the ‚ÄúHara Hachi Bu‚Äù, which is also called ‚ÄúThe 80% Rule‚Äù. As its name indicates, it means stopping to eat when you feel 80% full instead of the usual 100%.\nWhat about alcohol? There is a surprising amount of papers trying to prove that alcohol is good for your body. It is not. A serious study on red wine concluded that one or two glasses per day may be beneficial because‚Ä¶ you guessed it! Not the alcohol. It is actually the grapes‚Äô antioxidants. Nonetheless, people from the Mediterranean Blue Zones drink red wine (in moderation) and their longevity is no joke. This could be linked to their lifestyle. Enjoying a glass of wine with your loved ones could contribute to general happiness and increase life-expectancy.\nExercise is built in their daily lives. Sardinian men go through long stairs and climb up steep hills as their gym replacement. Not because they choose to, but because they must. There is no skipping leg day when raising farm animals. It is not unusual to get proper sleep when the body is exhausted, which is fantastic because it prevents heart diseases and strokes.
